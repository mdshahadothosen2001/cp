# Example 1:
# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

# Example 2:
# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
