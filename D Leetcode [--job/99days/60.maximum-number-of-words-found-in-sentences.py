# Example 1:
# Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: 
# - The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
# - The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
# - The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
# Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

# Example 2:
# Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. 
# In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.
