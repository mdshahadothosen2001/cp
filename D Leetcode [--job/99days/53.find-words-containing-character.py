# Example 1:
# Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.

# Example 2:
# Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
# Output: [0,2]
# Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.

# Example 3:
# Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
# Output: []
# Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.
